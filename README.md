2. Minimum 6 page writeup delivered in PDF or Word format including at least
the following items: (a) problem statement (what is your project supposed to

in optimization algorithms including any reading outside the textbook that
you found useful, and including citations to any resources (code or
otherwise) that you used in the project; (c) your decomposition of the project
into separate portions including all responsibilities and credits by group
member, pointing external code used in each portions, and any milestones or
checkpoints you used; (d) your experience in coding it up; (e) your

And of course, your all names.
2. Source and executable code delivery through EEE, with data if of reasonable
